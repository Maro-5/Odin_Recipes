# Odin Recipe Project 

This Recipe project was an assignment from the odin foundation course.
In this project I showed understanding of basic html by using headers, paragraphs, break tags, image elments and its different attributes. anchor elements and its href attribute(including target attribute to tell the brower where to open and rel attribute for security) to link between pages and websites. as well as ordered and unordered lists.
I used basic git commands to add, commit and push the project to github.
Using nesting and indentaion I made the code more readable.
